I recently completed an MVC project that follows a 3-tier architecture and utilizes the Code First approach. This project focuses on CRUD operations, providing a robust and efficient solution for managing data. ðŸ’»

Key Features:
 Implemented a 3-tier architecture for separation of concerns and maintainability.
 Utilized the Code First approach to streamline database design and development.
 Leveraged the Repository pattern for efficient data access and management.
 Incorporated AutoMapper for seamless mapping between entities and DTOs.
 Implemented authentication and authorization for secure user access.
 Utilized LINQ and Entity Framework Core for powerful and efficient data querying.

Throughout the development process, I utilized a range of tools and technologies, including Visual Studio (VS), Git & GitHub for version control, Postman for API testing, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for database management.

This MVC project demonstrates my ability to design and develop scalable and maintainable applications. By adhering to the 3-tier architecture, I ensured separation of concerns and created a clean and modular codebase. The Code First approach allowed for a flexible and efficient database design, while the Repository pattern simplified data access and management.

Authentication and authorization were implemented to ensure secure user access to the application, providing a seamless and protected user experience. Additionally, the use of AutoMapper facilitated the mapping between entities and DTOs, reducing manual coding efforts and enhancing development productivity.

LINQ and Entity Framework Core were instrumental in optimizing data querying operations, resulting in improved performance and seamless data retrieval.
